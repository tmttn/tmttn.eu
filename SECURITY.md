# Security Policy

## About This Project

This is a personal portfolio website built with Next.js and deployed as a static site. Since it's a simple static website with no user accounts, databases, or sensitive data handling, the security concerns are minimal.

## Dependency Security

- **Dependabot** is enabled for automatic dependency vulnerability detection
- **npm audit** runs regularly to check for package vulnerabilities
- Dependencies are updated promptly when security issues are identified

## Reporting Issues

If you discover a potential security issue:

1. **For dependency vulnerabilities**: Feel free to open a GitHub issue
2. **For other security concerns**: You can reach out via GitHub issues or the contact information on the website

Since this is a personal project without sensitive data, there's no formal vulnerability disclosure process.

## What This Site Does

- Displays portfolio information and projects
- Uses GitHub API to show public repository data
- Generates static pages with Next.js
- No user authentication or data collection
- No sensitive information stored or processed

*This is a personal project maintained by one person. The security policy reflects the simple nature of a static portfolio website.*
